# primitive_banking_application
Our team has come up with a extremely primitive banking application using the various known tools of C++. In this the user is able to create an account with his own choice of account number and also initial deposit amount, later he can also withdraw and deposit funds and also display the account information. The data of the program stays put till the runtime of the program.
Further this project can be extended to writing down the details of the created account to a file and also creating a tabulation of various operations performed by the account holder in a file and can be given to the user in a printed format
like a passbook.
